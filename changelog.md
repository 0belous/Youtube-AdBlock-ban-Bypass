🐞 Temporary fix for "double audio bug"
```
###### *If this breaks stuff even more complain in the feedback and I'll fix it*

Unfortunately I have not been able to get the issue to trigger in a development environment, if anyone who is who is getting this bug would like to do some testing, DM me on discord my username is `obelous`
